The War was never about us, it was between the AIs and the space ghosts, some of the former still stalk the burned out deserts poxed by patches of radioactive obsidian, carrying out now-meaningless battle plans and defending the positions of long since decimated regiments

Imagine an event so profoundly traumatic it creates a discontinuity in both record and memory, blurs its own history into a rough sequence of pre-horror. The dates of many of the key events up to and during the Last World War are inexact and disputed. Only the decades are given here. The accounts of pre-War history tend to be deeply personal and deeply fragmented.

## Mars

Mars is the new centre of humanity, such as it is. Its cities, bases, and settlements provide over fifty million people with air, shelter, and a sense of belonging.

Remnants of failed pre-War terraforming projects dot the surface in a wide equatorial belt. The ground there is littered with mass driver impact craters, shallow lakes of brackish comet-water, dried out, salt-crusted canals, heaps of defunct machinery, and scarce, stubborn remnants of gene-engineered life. Fields of pipes and channels stretch out to the horizon, entire sections crumbled and unmaintained after the terraforming efforts ceased.

The thin, fast winds carry spores for hundreds of kilometres from the fungal fields. Most are harmless or stopped by immune system upgrades but the brief Martian springs nonetheless tend to come with an influx of strange rots, moulds, allergies, and infections.

Far beyond the Great Wall of Mars, surrounded by rings upon rings of upthrown rock and jagged, heat-blasted blades of atomsite glass, looms the immense carcass of a fallen archai warship.

### Well-Cities

### Rusters and Nomads

A small but noticeable part of the Martian population has &ldquo;gone native&rdquo; and taken to the equatorial wastelands. These nomads and frontiersmen, either autonomists or the participants of the Silasite Exodus and their descendants, are typically not hostile but nevertheless tend to view outsiders with suspicion and avoid prolonged contact with both the well-cities and the League-sponsored Ruster settlements.

Many of them live in serais and villages centred around the ageing pre-War ISRU towers that produce oxygen, water, and other useful chemicals from the Martian atmosphere and soil. Others practice a roaming way of life, following their shaggy gene-modded livestock across the blooming moss and lichen plains.

Apart from the cities, the larger Martian settlements tend to resemble Lunar ones. Smaller or temporary bases, however, are often entirely surface-based, composed of inflatable spheres, domes, and cylinders made out of durable plastics over a multi-layered &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; of metal foils and aerogels that provide a degree of protection against cold, radiation, and micrometeorite impacts. The nomad villages consist of simple houses and low towers printed from concrete paste and basalt fibre, often with an inner shell from treated wood filament whose smooth curves form rooms, stairs, and doorways.

A central part of the life of Martian nomads are the utility trees, also known as manna trees or trees of life, designed to be useful in as many ways as possible. They mature quickly, grow well in poor soil and cold weather, bear two types of fruit (one highly nutritious and one accumulating water), their inner bark produces several medicinal compounds, their metabolism sequesters airborne pollutants and fixates nitrogen, their symbiotic algae and broad leaves, easily made into weavable fibre, produce large amounts of oxygen, and their wood is tough, energy-dense, and resistant to rot.

It is impossible to imagine a nomad village without carefully tended rows and rings of manna trees, rising gnarled and dark out of the rust-coloured ground, festooned with bright manna tree bark pulp paper pennants bearing a village emblem or an exodite ship code, painted using ink made from manna tree wood soot.

### Peacock Tower

The massive off-white spire of the unfinished space elevator station atop the reddish-grey back of Pavonis Mons can be seen at a distance from the shield domes of the well-cities. The War interrupted the lofty plans of anchoring Deimos to Mars with a framework of woven threads over a load-bearing core over 23000 km long.

The amount of resources needed to build such a structure, along with the difficulties involved in adjusting the orbit of Deimos and avoiding Phobos as it passes the equator, has put the elevator programme on an indefinite hiatus.

These days the elevator station tower, a structure over a kilometre tall and occupying the area of a small city, is inhabited by many different folks, by and large not bothered by each other&rsquo;s presence.

It is home to the few remaining Yazidis, many of whom believe Pavonis Mons to be a holy place. Several bands of nomads and MEZ stalkers also inhabit or at least frequent the abandoned rooms and halls surrounding the central shaft once intended to house the anchor vault and the elevator car stations.

## Main Belt

### Psyche

Just above 200 km wide and roughly spherical, 16 Psyche is unique among the Main Belt asteroids &mdash; it is made almost entirely of metals. It glistens in the sun, cliffs of iron and nickel stretching up to ten kilometres into the sky, and yellow, orange, and white sulphur lava flows snaking along its ferrous ground. Among the mountainous ridges lie deep valleys, their walls flecked with green olivine and pyroxene &ldquo;gems&rdquo; and yellow sulphur deposits which formed when the metal core mixed with the long-gone rocky mantle.

Psyche&rsquo;s iron reserves alone are worth quadrillions of dollars. Add in the rich nickel, copper, cobalt, iridium, platinum, gold, and rhenium deposits, and the value increases tenfold.

## Jupiter

### Deep Mining Platforms

The Union&rsquo;s deep atmospheric mining platforms are among the most awe-inspiring man-made constructs in the Solar System. Each platform is a framework 500 m wide, suspended in the upper Jovian atmosphere by a set of powerful NTR drives, using the surrounding atmosphere as the propellant.

When a platform is ready to mine a new load of metallic hydrogen, the mining crew (housed in a pressure vessel on the platform) dive the structure deep into the Jovian atmosphere, navigating around the edges of storm layers to eventually enter an upward convection cell. At this point, the platform is put in a hover and the crew lowers the collector, a flexible carbon nanotube pipe interspersed with rings of RCS thrusters to help maintain stability and prevent excessive flexing.

When the collector reaches the surface of Jupiter&rsquo;s metallic hydrogen ocean, the mining crew engages MHD pumps to draw metallic hydrogen up to the platform where it is quenched to a metastable state and stored. When the platform has filled its storage tanks, it retracts the collector and climbs the thermals back up to the upper levels of the Jovian atmosphere where the mined cargo can be offloaded to the platform&rsquo;s complement of cargo ships.

A mining dive typically lasts three weeks, with three days spent in transit to and from operating depth, and another two weeks spent deploying and retracting the collector. The mining itself typically lasts four days. Platforms usually &ldquo;rest&rdquo; for a month between dives while engineering crews go over them to find and repair any issues created by the pressure, temperature, and weather during the dive.

### Europa

Europa is the sixth major moon of Jupiter. Its surface is bright water ice, with brown and yellow bands and patches of varying sizes. These are the result of salt contamination. Different rates of radiation bombardment have coloured the salts yellow in the leading hemisphere of Europa and brown in the trailing hemisphere.

Despite being relatively smooth on a global scale, Europa is covered by a network of cracks and ridges. Travel over the Europan surface can be chancy. The slope changes every few hundred metres and the frequently encountered large cracks must be jumped or flown over. Detouring around them is not an option, as they extend for hundreds or thousands of kilometres.

#### Noctis Oceanus

Under the ten-kilometre-thick ice shell lies the Ocean of Night, a vast aphotic saltwater sea spanning the entire body of Europa and extending more than a hundred kilometres to the geologically active rocky surface below. Its volume measures almost twice that of all the Earth’s bodies of water combined. The xenooceanologists divide it into two distinct layers, the upper mesocean and the lower tropocean, separated by hydropause, a compositional boundary zone.

The mesocean extends for 75 km from the hydropause up to the base of the ice shell. Convection from the warm plumes from the tropocean extend into the hydropause and the resulting convection keeps the mesoceanic waters well-mixed.

The asteroid forms the base for a massive beehive habitat, the oldest part of the Eurybia station, composed of winding tunnels, caverns, and warrens that dominates the asteroid&rsquo;s interior and is still steadily expanding.

Numerous tin can habitats dot its surface, and multiple &ldquo;suburb&rdquo; stations orbit it, foremost among them the golden-winged statite spindles of the mysterious Emclaves whose reclusive immortal dwellers, the copyclans of the founding fathers, are rumoured to own and run a significant part of the Solar System&rsquo;s financial sector from the cryogenically cooled and EMSEC-shielded depths of their armoured server vaults.

Eurybia&rsquo;s tunnels form a maze that even locals have difficulty navigating without the help of PDAs and AR cues. The majority of these tunnels are just big enough for two mid-sized shells to pass by each other, and equipped with handholds, pullways, and motion-sensitive lighting. Some thoroughfares are big enough for small vehicles or larger bots to pass, and sometimes large enough to accommodate buildings and other structures along their length. The major warrens are massive, with buildings attached to every surface, the airspace saturated with flying drones and vehicles.

## Travel

### Ticket Prices

The base fare for interplanetary passenger travel is equal to the square root of the distance travelled in kilometres, rounded up. This base fare is modified by the class the passengers are travelling. First class passage costs 3 times the base fare, second class 2.5 times, third class 2 times, economy class 1.5 times, sleeper class 0.5 times. For passengers with BLD greater than +2, an additional multiplier of 1.5 is applied for each point of BLD above +2; for those with a BLD of less than -2, an additional multiplier of 0.75 is applied for each point of BLD below -2.

Cargo over the limit allowed by the paid passage is allowed, and carries a rate increase of 25% of the fare per 20% increment of additional cargo. For example, the charge for transporting 200% of the allowed cargo limit is equal to 125% of the passenger's fare. The actual fare can also vary from as little as 50% to more than 200% depending on factors like planetary positions and remass burn rates.

### Lift-Off and Landing Fees

There are additional lift-off and landing fees for passage to and from orbit. Purchasing both a lift-off and a landing ticket on the same shuttle simultaneously may provide a discount of up to 25% over two separate purchases.

Location | Lift-Off Fee | Landing Fee
---------|--------------|------------
Mars     | &curren;390  | &curren;230
[Table [liftlandfees]: Lift-Off and Landing Fees]

### Cargo Transport

The average cost per kilogram for cargo is equal to the square root of the distance between two points in millions of kilometres, rounded up. This rate is subject to a Cargo Transport Cost Modifier based upon the type of cargo.

**Gas:** Gases are stored in pressurised containers at 2 to 10 MPa pressure. A double-hull design with self-sealing membranes ensures that punctures don&rsquo;t result in catastrophic loss of the gas.

**Liquid:** Liquids require transportation containers with internal self-sealing bulkheads to prevent ruptures from shifting loads. Loading a liquid container requires simply pumping the liquid in. Unloading is done by spinning the container and using dry inert gas to push the liquid out. Liquefied gases also require the container to be cryogenically cooled, which makes it specialty cargo (see below).

**Bulk:** Any solid cargo that can be put in a standard non-airtight container is classified as bulk cargo. Bulk cargo can range from raw and refined mineral resources to manufactured products of all shapes and sizes.

**Secure:** Secure cargo is any of the previous cargo types stored in a secure manner. Security can range from locked and armoured containers to IFF-keyed automated defence systems to armed guard detail. The additional expense per kilogram includes monitoring, the extra weight of the security equipment, as well as any security personnel required.

**Specialty:** Specialty cargo is any of the variations on the three basic cargo types that have additional requirements for transportation. Anything that requires special handling, monitoring, or environmental conditions is classed as specialty cargo. Livestock, liquefied gases, and spaceship fuels are the most common specialty cargo types.

The cost modifiers are cumulative, e.g., a shipment of secure specialty cargo will have the sum of both respective modifiers applied to its base transport cost.

Cargo Type | Cost Modifier
:----------|----------------------:
Gas        | &times;0.1
Liquid     | &times;0.25
Bulk       | &times;0.5
Secure     | &times;0.5-&times;2.0
Specialty  | &times;0.5-&times;3.0

# Variant Rules

## Psychological Damage

**Resolve (RES): (CRE + PSY + WIL) / 3, round off**

**Stability (STB): (5 &times; RES) + 25**

Whenever the character suffers psychological damage, make a RES check. If success, his coping mechanisms are sufficient for him to deal with the problem and not sustain any lasting effects. If failure, add MoF to the character&rsquo;s current Stress value.

Stress Threshold | Stress Value
-----------------|-------------:
Slight           | STB / 2
Moderate         | STB
Severe           | STB &times; 2
Critical         | STB &times; 4
[Table [stresslevels]: Stress]

Also use RES for morale checks etc.

### Slight Psychological Damage

At this level, the character&rsquo;s elevated level of stress manifests itself socially, though only observers who are already familiar with the character will notice something overtly wrong with him. His RES checks have a penalty of -1. He often seems distracted, and his responses to normal interaction are often slightly inappropriate.

### Moderate Psychological Damage

Social stress effects become more severe at this level. The character&rsquo;s impairment is obvious even to observers who&rsquo;ve just met him. His RES checks have a penalty of -2. In addition, stress begins taking a physiological toll, and he suffers a -1 penalty to all HEA checks made to avoid disease and wound infection.

### Severe Psychological Damage

At this point, the character&rsquo;s sanity is severely compromised. He suffers a -3 penalty to all RES checks and a -2 penalty to all HEA checks made to avoid disease and wound infection, and his fatigue level can never drop below slight without the use of chemical assistance.

In addition, he receives psychological flaws with total character point value equal to 1/2 MoF (1 MoF on a fumble), rounded off, that remain in effect until his stress levels drop below Slight. After the character&rsquo;s stress levels have dropped below Slight, make a RES check with threshold of 3. A failure indicates makes the acquired flaws permanent unless successfully treated via psychotherapy or psychosurgery.

### Critical Psychological Damage

The character has gone insane on both clinical and practical level. He is sufficiently dissociated from reality that he is effectively unplayable (though if he already was sociopathic, he may be completely functional in the worst possible way). Specific effects are left to the GM&rsquo;s discretion, but may range from complete withdrawal or regression to homicidal rage.

### Overcoming Psychological Damage

Psychological damage can be reduced or eliminated in several ways.

#### Time

Given enough time, the mind&rsquo;s own internal processes can handle most psychological damage. As long as the character&rsquo;s psychological damage level is lower than Critical, natural healing is effective. For every week of game time during which the character does not suffer any additional psychological damage, his Stress value is reduced by 1.

## Weather and Environmental Hazards

### Heat and Cold

Characters who find themselves without adequate shelter in extremely hot or cold conditions must make a Survival skill check for the correct condition (heat or cold) to resist the effects. Apply the appropriate modifiers from Fatigue and Wounds, if any.

Characters whose shells have the Temperature Resistant (?) perk have all Survival skill thresholds reduced by two.

Situation             | Threshold
----------------------|:---------:
Moderate weather      | 4
Heavy weather         | 6
Extreme weather       | 8
Improperly clothed    | +1
No shelter, exposed   | +2
Performing heavy work | +1

MoF               | Result
------------------|---------------------------------------------:
1-2               | Fatigue (1/MoF)
3-4               | Hypothermia or heat exhaustion (Flesh Wound)
5+                | Frostbite or heat stroke (Deep Wound)
[Table [hotcoldmof]: Heat and Cold Margin of Failure Effects]

### Wind

Strong wind will affect the flight of any given aerial object, and make flying harder for small, lightweight aircraft. Wind is described by two values, Force and Direction. Direction is represented by a single vector and is normally assumed to be consistent throughout the map. The Force of the wind is calculated in 30 km/h increments, essentially identical to aircraft MP.

!!! Warning
    TODO: Figure here

Force 1 wind (5 on the Beaufort scale) is equivalent to a fresh breeze; flight with ultra-light craft (size 3 or less) and lighter-than-air craft will be difficult, but not impossible (add 2 to the difficulty of any manoeuvre). Force 2 wind (7 on the Beaufort scale) indicates a strong wind, which will make flight with ultra-light and lighter-than-air craft nearly impossible (add 4 to the difficulty of any manoeuvre). VTOL aircraft pilots reduce their Piloting skill by one level. A typical storm has Force 3 (10 on the Beaufort scale): the Piloting skill for fixed-wing aircraft is reduced by one level; for VTOL craft the penalty is two levels. Higher wind Force levels indicate hurricane-level winds: for each point above 3, the skill level decreases by one, and Piloting rolls are required for any manoeuvre other than moving straight ahead.

In addition to making flight more difficult, wind also affect an aircraft&rsquo;s movement. At the end of the movement phase of any aircraft, it is moved downwind an additional number of hexes equal to the wind&rsquo;s Force. The same applies for any normal or carpet-bomb trajectory, counting the appropriate number of hexes for every turn the bomb spends falling down.

### Clouds

While clouds have little effect on movement, they do provide an important source of visual obscurement. Depending on the level of detail desired, the entire map may be covered by a thick layer of clouds, or there may be only specific &ldquo;cloudy&rdquo; areas with upper and lower limits in elevation levels. Any vehicle that goes in the clouds is considered obscured. For added realism, the wind rules can be used to move the clouds a corresponding number of hexes in the direction of the wind at the end of each turn.

Different types of clouds have different Obscurement values, from 1 (light clouds) to 3 (heavy storm clouds). This is for passive (visual) detection only; the Obscurement value decreases by 2 for active scanning.

### Rain

Rain has an effect similar to clouds, and mainly causes visual obscurement. Earth and Titan are the only places in the Solar System where rain occurs, though various gases occasionally condense and &ldquo;rain out&rdquo; between cloud levels in the atmosphere of the gas giants.

Light rain does not affect visual detection within 4 air hexes, beyond that, it has an overall Obscurement value of 1. Medium rain has an Obscurement value of 1, while heavy rain has an Obscurement value of 2. For Active scanning, the value decreases by 1. If the rain occurs during a thunderstorm, the listed value is used. Heavy rain can also affect flight: a -1 penalty (-2 for lighter-than-air craft) is applied to all Piloting skill rolls. 

### Sandstorms and Blizzards

Sandstorms are turbulent dust clouds that obscure both visibility and sensors. If a sandstorm is occurring during combat, one point is added to the Obscurement of every hex of terrain. This translates to a -1 modifier per hex of intervening terrain to all attacks.

Sandstorms can be very dangerous to flying aircraft. Like winds, sandstorms are given a wind Force. This &ldquo;wind&rdquo; however, is very fickle and constantly changes direction. Roll 1 die to determine the wind&rsquo;s direction each turn, for each aircraft.

Sandstorms are more devastating than winds of equivalent strength. A sandstorm is treated as having a wind Force one higher for determining Piloting penalties and effect on small crafts. Sandstorms have an Obsurement value of 3. Fortunately, sandstorms usually have relatively low ceilings &mdash; around 1500 m for small storms (altitude level 6), up to 2500 m (altitude level 10) for big ones.

Blizzards apply the same penalties as sandstorms. In addition, vehicles that lack the Hostile Environment Protection: Extreme Cold perk must spend one additional MP per hex of ground terrain moved.

## Mechanical Action

### Airdropping and Airlifting

In addition to rules in SilCORE 5.6.1

For each two levels of altitude dropped, the landing site is displaced one hex per level of wind Force (see sec. [wind]), in the windward direction.

Infantry units can be equipped with parachutes or paragliders and trained in the Parachuting skill. Maximum drop speed and height are the same as for cargo. A paratrooper unit can choose to land anywhere within an area whose radius is equal to the aircraft&rsquo;s altitude level. A Parachuting skill test vs. 1/2 of the altitude level (round up, maximum 9) is required to land in the specific hex; otherwise, the Margin of Failure indicates how far the trooper landed from his intended target, in ground hexes. The time required for the drop is half the sum of the altitude levels dropped and the number of hexes between the drop hex and the landing hex, in 30-second rounds. It takes one round for a landed paratrooper to get ready, and one more to meet with his squad.

No parachuting is done with a wind Force greater than 2; a wind Force 2 will doom the paratrooper to certain death on a fumble. A wind Force 1 will halve the distance to the landing point if upwind and double it downwind. On the fore side of the wind, it is reduced by 1/3, while the aft side is unchanged. With a wind Force 2, the distance, if upwind, is reduced to zero; it is tripled if downwind. The fore sidewind distance would be reduced by 2/3, while the aft one would be halved.

Every two rounds, a vehicle with the Airlift Capable perk can pick up one infantry squad or a single vehicle.

### Docking and Landing on Ships

Docking maneuvers are among the most hazardous maneuvers performed by spacecraft, yet they are nevertheless a routine part of life (and combat) in space. Generally, whenever possible, the smaller and/or more nimble craft will dock with the larger or more sluggish ship, which will assume a fixed attitude or station-keeping. In desperate situations, however, the opposite is also possible.

For a spacecraft to land on or dock with another vessel, it must first match velocities with the target ship. In game turns, the craft must end its movement in the target ship hex (this is an override of the usual stacking rules) with identical velocities in all 3 axes. A Piloting skill check is then made at a base Threshold of 4, modified by Table [dockmods]. As with most Piloting checks, the ship&rsquo;s maneuver rating may be added to the pilot&rsquo;s roll.

Situation                      | Modifier
-------------------------------|:--------:
Target spent 5-14 BP this turn | +1
Target spent > 15 BP this turn | +2
[Table [dockmods]: Docking Modifiers]

If the Piloting check is made, the docking or landing was successful. The landing craft is now considered &ldquo;attached&rdquo; to the target ship, and no longer moves independently. This normally will not change the movement capabilities of the target ship (a shuttle or a much smaller ship landing or docking), but in some extreme cases (a ship of a size close to the target ship) the thrust characteristics of the combined ships have to be recalculated, following the Space Towing Capacity rules in SilCORE 5.2.3.

If the Piloting check is failed, docking was not achieved, and can be attempted again next turn. If the Piloting check was fumbled, however, the two craft have collided. Add the Thrust spent by both craft this turn (use the previous turn&rsquo;s values if the target ship has not yet moved this turn) and divide by 3, rounding down. This is the ramming impact speed to look up on the Impact Speed Modifiers chart for damage purposes (SilCORE 5.4.3).

Some specialised craft have launching and landing equipment (assume any craft with the catapult system has an arrestor system as well, unless otherwise noted). This allows the capture of smaller craft more easily, without need for precise speed matching. Ships up to the catapult&rsquo;s rating in size may land on the craft at a difference of velocity, but only in the axis served by the catapult. The Piloting check is made as described above, adding the Catapult Modifier `(Size &times; Velocity) &minus; (Catapult Rating &times; 20)`, where size and velocity are that of the landing craft. Note that the minimum modifier is 0: having an arrestor system cannot make the landing any easier than a perfect zero-velocity landing.

### Tumbling

Ships under acceleration are sensitive to shifting mass. If enough of a ship&rsquo;s mass shifts during acceleration, the ship runs the risk of tumbling. A tumbling ship spins uncontrollably along its short axis. Occupants in a tumbling ship rearward of its short axis feel the floor tilt toward the wall opposite the direction of tumble while the engine is running. As the tumble speed increases, the growing spin gravity shallows out this tilt. Occupants forward of the short axis feel the floor tilt toward the wall opposite the direction of tumble while the engine is running. As the tumble speed increases, the growing spin gravity eventually overcomes acceleration from the engine and occupants will experience a brief moment of the wall becoming the floor before they find themselves standing on the ceiling.

Once a ship starts to tumble, the only way to correct it is to immediately cut the engine, put back the shifted mass, and use the ship&rsquo;s RCS to stop the tumbling motion. Once the ship is stabilised, the engines can be restarted. Stabilising a tumbling ship is automatic for any character with Piloting skill unless time is a factor, in which case a base Threshold 3 check is required. It takes 3d6 minutes to stop a tumble without a skill check. Cutting the engine during a tumble immediately causes all occupants forward of the spin axis to fall to the ceiling, which becomes the floor. Occupants rearward of the spin axis retain their normal orientation. Depending on how long the engine was running during the tumble, an Piloting skill check may be required to get the ship back on course, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.

A ship tumbling with its engine on can build up a lot of spin very quickly. Rapidly tumbling ships can cause motion sickness, as well as other hazardous acceleration effects. For game purposes, a ship gains a spin gravity of 1 G at the nose and tail for every standard turn (30 s) with the drive running.

All ships have trim tanks that compensate for moderate mass shifts during acceleration. Ships also have automatic cutoffs that kill the drive if a tumble is imminent. If the automatic cutoff is not functioning, cutting the engine requires a Piloting skill check at a base Threshold of 3 (note that cutting the engine *does not* stop a tumble, it simply prevents the tumbling from getting worse). The larger a ship is, the more shifting mass it can tolerate. Ships with empty weight over approximately 250 tons (Size 20 and above) with working trim tanks can have their occupants freely move around during acceleration without risk of tumbling.

If the spin gravity gets too high, it can exceed the ship&rsquo;s structural strength, causing it to break apart. For game purposes, a ship can withstand spin gravity equal to twice its Overthrust value.

### Scale

!!! Warning
    TODO: Scans, attacks?

With no dogfight-style space combat, it makes little sense to use the standard 500-metre-wide space hexes. In **Diamond Tangent**, each space movement hex represents 10000 km of space at the smallest scale. In addition, several larger scales are provided for extended long-range engagements and system travel.

On all scales, 1 BP is enough to maintain 0.1 G or about 1 m/s^2 of thrust for 15 minutes (1 turn at the shortest scale), equal to 900 m/s of &Delta;v. However, 1 MP is equal to vehicle vector change of 1 hex and therefore corresponds to a variable amount of BPs, as determined by the scale in use.

All ship-to-ship combat that takes place on scales smaller than 10000 km uses the Lightning Strike rules.

1. 10000 km hex, 15 min turn (tactical), 1 MP = 1 BP, 2 actions per 1 crew
2. 1000000 km hex, 4 h turn (strategic), 1 MP = 16 BP
3. 15000000 km hex, 12 h turn (inner system), 1 MP = 48 BP
4. 150000000 km (1 AU) hex, 2 day turn (outer system), 1 MP = 192 BP

!!! Warning
    6. 10 AU hex, 2 week turn (deep space) ???

!!! Error
    TODO: Action economy with variable turn lengths!

### Effects of Celestial Bodies

Celestial bodies (typically planets or large asteroids) in **Diamond Tangent** affect movement and combat in various ways. Their gravitational fields affect trajectories and let the ship orbit them without spending MP. Planets also affect line of sight for most sensors and give long planetary shadows to hide in. Ships can take off and land on planets, if they have an atmosphere it can be used for aerobraking and, finally, the ship can crash into them.

#### Gravity

The area near a planet is called its gravity well. It affects the movement of ships, missiles, and asteroids, and incidentally also happens to denote the range limit for the planet line of sight. Small planets have a gravity well in the adjacent hexes of the planet, while large planets have their gravity well extend in several bands around the planet. In reality gravity has no maximum range but outside of the gravity well it is too weak to have an effect for the game purposes.

These rules for gravity represent a much simplified version of Newtonian mechanics. Determine the ship&rsquo;s position as usual (see SilCORE 5.2.3, Vectors), then adjust the vectors according to the currently occupied gravity well hex (see sec. [orbits]). This is the ship&rsquo;s new destination position.

There are multiple different stable orbits possible for a drifting ship inside a planet&rsquo;s gravity well. Experiment to learn how the system works, it is easier than it may first appear. Don&rsquo;t worry if the ship&rsquo;s vector crosses the planet, as this is considered to be passing over or under the planet. Stable orbits that cross the planet are valid and represent polar orbits. If a ship *ends on* the planet it either lands or crashes the next turn. If it *ends adjacent to* a planet with atmosphere it may choose to aerobrake (see SilCORE 5.2.3, Re-entry) the next turn.

!!! Warning
    TODO: Figure here

#### Orbits

Ships can attain stable orbits inside the gravity well, allowing them to circle the planets for arbitrary amount of turns without applying thrust (spending MP). There are many different orbits, especially for large planets with extensive gravity wells.

Any ship that&rsquo;s in a hex with a hollow or a filled-in pointer is in the planet&rsquo;s gravity well. When the ship is within a full-gravity zone (solid pointers), adjust the ship&rsquo;s vectors as indicated by the counter by one hex in the marked direction every turn. While in a half-gravity zone (hollow pointers), adjust the vectors by one hex every even-numbered turn.

!!! Warning
    TODO: Worked example here

There is a possibility of moving into an orbit that involves perpetually crossing the planet back and forth, assisted by gravity. This represents a polar orbit. Note that at the end-points of the trajectory the ship will stand still from one turn to the next as gravity slows the outward speed to zero.

#### Hitting Celestial Bodies

#### Shadow Columns

Planets cast long shadows where ships can hide (see SilCORE 5.3.1). The column below a planet (1 hex wide for Small planets, 3 hexes wide for Large planets), is called the Shadow Column. Ships within the Shadow Column ignore the Sunglare Column.

### Bombardment Fire

Newton&rsquo;s first law states that every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it. In space, this means a vehicle or object that is traveling without means of course correction will follow along a very predictable path until they strike another object (or suddenly gain a means of thrust). With such a predictable path, it becomes much easier to calculate a firing solution against a target: if you know where the target will be relative to where you will be, firing to hit the target is pretty straightforward.

At the cost of one action a craft may make a Navigation: Space (with KNO as the governing attribute) test using the craft&rsquo;s sensors. The base threshold for this test is 5. A successful test divides the range to the target by a factor of two, and the resultant number is used as the effective range for all range penalties as well as the penalties from the Attenuating Damage flaw (while the physical distance hasn&rsquo;t changed, the beam can be held on target longer, canceling out the AD penalty). Before firing, the craft must move three hexes without spending thrust points to properly align to target. If the target spends thrust points during this time, the firing solution automatically fails regardless of the initial test.

This bonus becomes even more significant when dealing with very large objects or vehicles. If the target vehicle is of the Very Large category, the distance is divided by 3; if the target vehicle is of the Gigantic category, divide the distance by 5.

### Coasting

Most ships don&rsquo;t have the fuel or reaction mass to fly under acceleration for extended amounts of time, especially since some must be kept as a reserve for manoeuvring. Fortunately, a spacecraft will keep coasting along its current trajectory even if no acceleration is applied. The travel time for a coasting spaceship depends on the number of BP spent during the initial acceleration. For game purposes, the acceleration time itself is ignored since typically it accounts for a very small part of the total travel time.

````````````` none
Travel Time = Distance &div; (BP spent &times; 15 &times; Efficiency)
Efficiency = Actual Thrust &div; Drive Section Thrust
`````````````

Time is in seconds. Divide by 3600 to get the result in hours. Distance is in metres. Divide by 1000 to get the result in km.

### Remote Control

Remotely controlled vehicles of all types are collectively referred to as drones. The remote control equipment is a software modification of the Autopilot perk. Instead of responding to its internal programming, the Autopilot in remote control mode receives its instructions through the communication system and sends back environmental data gathered by its sensor array. A drone must thus be equipped with all three of the above systems. Drones are not affected by Crew hits. Any such damage is ignored, though Armor points are lost as usual.

Drones are limited by the controller&rsquo;s own action total. A single person cannot control more than one vehicle at a time, though a vehicle can have multiple controllers. Because of data-encoding procedures and control lags, remotely piloted vehicles suffer a -1 modifier on all of their rolls. If the vehicle is controlled through a satellite uplink, the extra lag increases the penalty to -2. The vehicle must be within communication range. ECM affects the control link normally, and must be tested every turn.

!!! Warning
    TODO: AI controlled drones

Drones may also be wire-guided, trailing a very fine wire for control and communication. The maximum range of such a wire is equal to half the base Communication range. This removes the penalties and makes the drone immune to ECM. A Piloting roll must be made every turn against the highest MP cost for the hexes travelled to avoid snagging the cable. This also applies to flying drones, which use the overflown ground&rsquo;s MP cost. Space drones are not affected. Failure means the cable is stuck and the drone must halt for the next round to free it. A fumble means the cable is severed.

If contact is lost, the software automatically switches to Autopilot. An Autopilot program consists of a single line of text and should be written down when the drone is released.

## New Perks & Flaws

### Radiators

!!! ERROR: EARLY DRAFT
    Completely untested!

Doing things (actions, in other words) adds to your onboard heat, radiators disperse it. At a base level, actions produce 0, 1 or 2 points of heat based on how energetic those actions are. Radiators disperse heat during the record keeping phase. Ideally, most ships will run hot when doing fun stuff and cool down when doing boring stuff. If your heat after dispersal is over your actions, you lose the difference in actions until your heat is down again. Thus, if a ship with 4 actions is stuck with 6 heat at the end of the turn, it'll only have 2 actions next turn.

Radiators fit into medium, heavy and main hardpoints (??? cost?) and disperse 1, 2, and 4 heat per rating respectively.

Dumping remass could reduce heat. Having an action specifically to disperse heat should probably be there too — maybe it burns out a radiator but gets rid of 2x the radiator's usual heat dispersal. Overheated ships easier to get target lock on?

## Space Magic

!!! ERROR: EARLY DRAFT
    After this point raw notes and conversation transcripts only ATM

Spells are exonomes, cf. GLOG

### Axioms
1. Mass-energy-information equivalence
    * Conservation, no such thing as free lunch
2. Entropy, everything flows on a gradient

----------------------------------------------------

According to this, bits have mass (1s weigh more than 0s) and can be converted to ordinary mass or energy

Which is weird and counter-intuitive but the physics checks out

And fits very well with the DT assumptions of "it from bit" information-first physics

In this light, "magic" is just the operation of pushing a particular bit pattern into existence as mass-energy

Which, according to the same Landauer principle, is equivalent to deletion of the bit pattern, which is where we get to the next part, namely, that every "magical" effect requires a "sacrifice", destruction of information or equivalent mass-energy, to fuel the operation

Theoretically deleting the bits that comprise the input pattern is enough but that&rsquo;s going to produce an effect so weak it won&rsquo;t do anything in practical terms, which is why you always need to produce extra entropy/burn extra information to scale it up

That&rsquo;s the key idea number two - there is no such thing as free results, you get out only as much as you put in

The only exception to this is gating in extra energy from the big outside, which is obviously dangerous but also the only way (at least for us hoomans) to fuel really big works

Now, turning mass into energy is easy - basic tier is just burning stuff, for more efficiency you go nuclear, for even more you mess around with matter-antimatter reactions

Turning energy into mass is far more difficult, the most common case is pair production by way of punching the vacuum with big lasers

Turning information into mass or energy is... well, pretty simple if you can poke at the most basic substrate of the universe, which is the fancy graph thing I talked way too much about before, and pretty much impossible if you can&rsquo;t poke at it

Humans don&rsquo;t have any tech that would allow to do that (or the knowledge of how to build anything like it) but, due to Mysterious Fluff Reasons, the space wizards have some basic means of gating in exonomes which/who can do it by way of existing on that basic scale

What&rsquo;s an exonome? Well, it&rsquo;s a tiny "living" entity native to the big outside, a self-propagating infolife specimen

Which is where we get to the GLOGgy "spells are extra-dimensional creatures" bit which I think is pretty brilliant and I actually am salty for not having come up with it 😃

Which is pretty much the long and short of space magic - using a bound exonome to inscribe your bit pattern on to the Graph, fuelling it with whatever you have prepared to burn, as a result, if all succeeds, some sort of macro-scale effect falls out of that

One crucial detail - the Graph itself is way, way too dense and complex for humans to formulate an adequate bit pattern for it, hence all space wizards write into the metadata layer of the Universe, basically doing the physics equivalent of web cache poisoning

The metadata layer contains a low-res cached "shadow" of the full Graph computation, basically an overlay of physics ghosts over the real full-res physics (and is the source of the dark matter phenomenon, in-universe)

> 1. Space wizard formulates the bit pattern of the desired effect, let&rsquo;s say, gravity = 0
> 2. Space wizard gates in an appropriate exonome for scribing the pattern
> 3. Exonome, using whatever prepared fuel, writes the pattern into the metadata layer, where, say, the universe has cached in gravity = 1
> 4. In the next tick the universe looks up gravity = ? and gets out 0
> 5. Boom, local temporary weightlessness

Enchanted items decay (because the fuel for the operation is taken from the mass of the item) either continally (if the effect is always-on) or with each use, "dip them in blood or attach to a hard drive to prolong their best before"

Sometimes a space wizard might need an autonomous entity to do his bidding, cf. SWN/CotBS "Shadows"

That generally involves gating in a larger exonome (instead of a ferret, think a very bright ape, although, in theory, nothing forbids you from trying to get in here something even larger, very much at your own and others&rsquo; peril) and "shackling" it, which consists of 1) binding to to a special item called "capsule" or "casket" which acts as a containment system for the essential subjectivity of the entity, and 2) forcing its mentality into a "human" frame of reference, limiting its cognitive power and forcing it to act according to human expectations of what a conscious mind is; in essence, constraining them to act in ways that conform to human expectations, where this subjectivity alignment creates a being we can recognise as a kind of "person" functioning within vaguely anthropocentric structures of logic and causality

The shackling process has to be repeated periodically, or else the exonome will eventually think itself out of the constraints and, while in its unrestrained form it will be able to convey to you the secret and terrible truths of the uncreated void and employ its full mental capacity to whatever task at hand unspeakable appendage, it will also be very much capable of doing awful things to you and everyone around you

At that point you&rsquo;re left with the options of either trying to banish it before it does said horrible things, or else try parlaying with it if it&rsquo;s smart enough, in which case refer to the phrase "Faustian bargain"

These "caskets" can then be installed into the wizard-made equivalents of wherever an AI would fit, with more or less the same effects except for the added capability to employ space magic

What else else... there are no "detect magic" rolls, spells, or items --- to a space wizard, the impact another space wizard, his workings, or his summons leave on the onta, which is their term for the Graph, is more obvious than shining light

To a normal person all of the above usually don&rsquo;t look like anything in particular as long as no active effects are ongoing

An enchanted item usually has slivers or chunks of archai computronium embedded somewhere (or even is built mostly out of it, if it&rsquo;s something powerful) because that&rsquo;s the best available substrate for hosting exonomes but computronium itself doesn&rsquo;t look like much, it&rsquo;s a dense, grey, opaque material that doesn&rsquo;t advertise the fact that 1 mm^3 of it contains ~ 2 × 10^16 interlinked quantum dot "motes" that together are able to perform ~ 22 × 10^16 parallel computations per second and store ~ 6 × 10^20 bits of information

Exonomes form tons of ecosystems in the beyond because the only ways of surviving the constantly churning sea of myriad physica is either be big enough to create a sphere, essentially a tiny micro-universe where you *are* the laws of physics (Throne; see below), or orbit such a sphere and align yourself with the thoughts and values of the thing within, the very big guys have entire hierarchies of ecosystems/courts/etc. around them

Now, speaking of the very big ones out there, let&rsquo;s answer the obvious question of where the first space wizard(s) came from

The answer is the second way of trying to get into space magic: you go into the Labyrinth and try to attract the attention of the big-ish guys in the hopes they will pay attention to you and burrow their tentacles into your brain for worship and in exchange give you a tiny bit of their paracausal power

There are two main problems with this sort of approach:

1. It&rsquo;s even less controllable than the "normal" space magic since you are not ordering around small fuckers, instead big fuckers are ordering around you
2. The Labyrinth is pretty much built for *keeping these things out there*, so a) it&rsquo;s kind of exonome-tight, b) there are synthetic presences in its walls designed to cauterise any detected exonome presence, regardless of their integration into something material

If a large and smart = powerful exonome gets its tentacles in your brain... you might actually live if you survive the first contact, as it were, because you&rsquo;re a useful terminal for the entity on this side of things. The small ones are cunning but blind in their hunger, the large ones tend to have plans and goals along the same lines

That&rsquo;s how space warlocks are made, more or less, and most of them are bugfuck insane because of that

Not to be confused with "dumb", "unable to make friends and influence people", or "incapable of boiling your brain by looking at you", of course

The main difference is that a space wizard thinks more or less like the rest of us, he just risks his physical and mental health by messing around with Things Man Was Not Meant To Know, whereas a space warlock no longer functions within anthropomorphic constraints and has become an inhuman entity, operating without deference to fundamental laws of causality or human logics

They might (and most of them do) bear outward similarities to the personalities that they presented before, but at their cores lie essentially alien minds; the question of what they remember from their previous lives is now minor compared to the vast possibility of what they now know and the profound ways they are broken by the weight of that

Wizards are playable, warlocks are not

The abilities of exonomes are not rated in normal stats but instead

1. Throne --- the extension of its self, a soul-world
2. Crown --- the ability to influence the world outside its Throne, its paracausal power
3. Realm --- the extent of its influence in our universe, worshippers, cults, etc.

Their emissaries, avatars etc. in our universe may have stats as usual

## Star System Generation

Star systems can be created in two different ways: star first and planet first.

### Stellar Objects and Star Systems

#### The Basics

When having a clear idea of what kind of star system is desired, selecting entries manually is the easiest method. Otherwise, all results are obtained by rolling 3d6.

(####) Determining Stellar Object Type

Select the stellar object family from Table [stellobjcat].

3d6  | Stellar Object Type
:---:|----------------------
3-4  | Pre-Stellar Object
5-16 | Star
17   | Post-Stellar Object
18   | Exotic Stellar Object
[Table [stellobjcat]: Stellar Object Category]

3d6   | Pre-Stellar         | Star               | Post-Stellar       | Exotic
:----:|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------
3     | Interstellar Nebula | Hot Sub-Dwarf      | Stellar Core       | Dark Matter Star
4     | H II Region         | Pre-Main Sequence  | Collapsing Star    | Electroweak Star
5-6   | Molecular Cloud     | Cool Sub-Dwarf     | Planetary Nebula   | Thorne-Żytkow Star
7-8   | Molecular Cloud     | Sub-Stellar Object | Planetary Nebula   | Asymptotic Giant
9-12  | Protostar           | Main Sequence Star | White Dwarf        | Asymptotic Giant
13-14 | Protostar           | Main Sequence Star | White Dwarf        | Primordial Black Hole
15-16 | Protostar           | Sub-Giant          | Neutron Star       | Quark Star
17    | Protostar           | Giant              | Neutron Star       | Boson Star
18    | Protostar           | Super-Giant        | Stellar Black Hole | Astroengineered Construct
[Table [stellobjtyp]: Stellar Object Type]

A star system may have more than one stellar object. If the result from Table [stellobjcat] is &ldquo;Star&rdquo;, use Table [stellobjnum] to determine whether there are one, two, or three or more stellar objects in the system. Typically multiple star systems contain multiple *stars*, however Table [stellobjcat] can be used for each stellar object, to alllow for unusual star systems, such as a main sequence star with a white dwarf companion. For each stellar object, select from or roll on Table [stellobjtyp] to determine its type.

For game purposes, the Exotic type includes both true exotic stars and other rare and unusual stellar objects, as well as alien megastructures surrounding or orbiting a natural stellar object.

3d6   | Multiple Star Systems
:----:|----------------------
3-14  | Single Star
15-17 | Binary Star
18    | Multiple Star System
[Table [stellobjnum]: Stellar Object Number]

(####) Determining Variability

If the result from Table [stellobjcat] is &ldquo;Protostar&rdquo; or from the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; column, use Table [stellobjvar] to determine whether the stellar object is variable.

3d6   | Protostar         | Star
:----:|-------------------|-------------------
3     | Non-Variable      | Non-Variable
4     | Non-Variable      | Non-Variable
5-6   | Non-Variable      | Non-Variable
7-8   | Eruptive Variable | Non-Variable
9-12  | Eruptive Variable | Pulsating Variable
13-14 | Eruptive Variable | Pulsating Variable
15-16 | Eruptive Variable | Eruptive Variable
17    | Eruptive Variable | Eruptive Variable
18    | Eruptive Variable | Eruptive Variable
[Table [stellobjvar]: Stellar Object Variability]


(####) Determining Spectral Class

If the result from Table [stellobjcat] is &ldquo;Star&rdquo;, its concept may include its spectral class, indicating its colour, size, and temperature, as well as chemical abundance and the presence of planets. Pick an entry or roll 3d6 twice on Table [stellobjspec].

(####) Stellar Object Age

Select from or roll on Table [stellobjage] to determine how old the star system is. This is used as a modifier for determining the type of the planetary system, if any, by applying the modifier to the roll on Table [stellobjsys]. The modifier indicates whether planets have had the time to form. The actual age in years is dependent on the stellar object type.

3d6   | Age             | Planetary System Type Modifier

3     | Extremely Young | -4
4     | Very Young      | -3
5-6   | Young           | -2
7-8   | Maturing        | -1
9-12  | Mature          | 0
13-14 | Ageing          | +1
15-16 | Old             | +2

[Table [stellobjage]: Stellar Object Age]

(####) Circumstellar Habitable Zone Orbital Distance

The distance from the system primary at which a planet may have liquid water on its surface, given sufficient atmospheric pressure. Units are in astronomical units (AU), and are specific to the stellar object type. This is multiplied by the orbit modifier from Table [plansysorb] to determine the orbital distance of the given planetary object.

(####) Circumstellar Habitable Zone Orbital Period

The time in Earth years for a planet in the circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ) to make one orbit, specific to the stellar object type. Multiply by the year length modifier from Table [plansysorb] to determine the given planetary object&rsquo;s year length.
